	description = { \begin{quote}
	The timing constraint of a task can be hard or soft, depending on weather a rigorous validation of the timing constrained is required (hard) or not (soft).
	In practise a {\itshape hard real-time system invariably} has many {\itshape soft real-time jobs} and vice versa. 
	The deviation is not always as obvious as we made it out to be here and, moreover, is not always necessary. 
	In {\itshape real-time system} or {\itshape system} whenever we mean either {\itshape a hard-real time system} or a {\itshape soft real-time} system or when there is no ambiguity about which type of system is meant by it.
