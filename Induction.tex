\section{Induction}

\subsection{Proof by Induction}
In the proof \ref{} we have seen, 
that \lstinline!0! is the neutral element from the left if the natural numbers \lstinline!nat! is studiet as a group. 

Is should be shown that zero is is the natural element from the right:
\begin{lstlisting}
Theorem plus_n_0_first: for all n: nat
  n = n + 0.  
\end{lstlisting}

But the tactics which were inttopduced till know are not suffiently powerful to proof this theorem.

\begin{lstlisting}
\end{lstlisting}

Recall the mathematical priciple of induction.
