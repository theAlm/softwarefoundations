\section{Importing}


In order to use the definitions from the previous chapter we are going to compile 
\texttt{Basics.v} and import it.
(In case the book \label{â€¢} is used and the archive form was downloaded, this following steps can be skipped.)   

\subsection{Building Coq Libraries}

First of all we are creating a Coq project called {\itshape \_ CoqProject}.  
It is goint to map the current directory \texttt{.} to the directory where our files are kept (\texttt{lf}).
Using the CoqIDE, Proof General (we have not written what that is) or executing Coq via the command line the follwoing process differes.
Proof general is going to be referd to the literature.\\\
Create a file called \texttt{\_ coqProject} within the working directory, which contains the file \texttt{Basics.v}.
Within this file add the line 

\begin{lstlisting}
-Q. LF
\end{lstlisting}

Therefore the libray is going to be called \texttt{LF.Basics}. 
To make an executable file out of our \texttt{Basics.v} we are creating the \texttt{Basics.vo} file by one of the colloqing options.
Using the CoqIDE the file \texttt{Basics.v} should be opend and the button in the compile menue {\itshape compile Buffer} is clicked.
When using the command line the file \texttt{Basics.vo} can be build or compiled using the Coq  make-file utility.
The Cow-makefile utility is installed together with Coq.

\begin{lstlisting}
coq-makefile -f _CoqProject*.v -o Makefile
\end{lstlisting}

Moreover, run this command whenever you add or remove files to the  working directory  \texttt{lf} whenever files were added or removed.
To make the compiled version of \texttt{Basics.vo} the following command can be called
\begin{lstlisting}
make (** builds the complete directory)
make Basics.vo (** builds Basics.vo **)
\end{lstlisting}
Note that make compiles and calculates dependencies automatically. 
The Coq-compiler, which is called {\itshape coqc} can be called by 
\begin{lstlisting}
run coqc-Q.LF Basics.v.
\end{lstlisting}
But remember always to prefer \texttt{make} over compiling, because of the dependencies.\\
 
To include the compiled chapter \texttt{Basics.vo} into the sourcecode of the chapter \texttt{Induction.v} write
\begin{lstlisting}
From LF Require Export Basics.
\end{lstlisting}
Into the first line of the \texttt{Induction.v}-file.

 

\subsection{Potential Troubles}

If an error arises, which complains about missing identifiers, in the file the "load path" for Coq might not be set up correctly.
Cheking the loaded path by
\begin{lstlisting}
Print loadPath (**-> still figure out: is this a comandline command or a Coq-comand?**) 
\end{lstlisting} 
might be helpful. The errror message
\begin{lstlisting}
Compiled library Foo makes inconsistent assumptions over library Bar
\end{lstlisting}
might be generated, because different versions of Coq are installed on your machine.
In particualr  CoqIDe and Proof General can use differnt versions of Coq for compiling.

If the libraries 
\begin{lstlisting}
Unable to locate library Basics.
\end{lstlisting}

 ... to be continued
