In this section we want to investigate the encapsulated EDF-scheduler (earliest dedline first) from the schedulig procedure by \cite{K}. \\

Let's recap \glspl{real-time system} as in \cite{KBK}.
The process is defined as a sequential execution of a program on a processor. The execution ends after a finite number of steps. 
Therefore it corresponds to a finite execution of machine commands and is not separable. \\
A process is called periodic if it should be restated after a certain time called {\itshape the period}. Otherwise a process is called aperiodic or sporadic.\\

Furthermore, whenever as process is said to be {\itshape non-preemptive} the execution may not be interrupted between the beginning and ending of the process. 
It is called {\itshape preemptive} if it may be interrupted after any instruction.\\  
 
The slotted prirority modell from \cite{B} with  sporadic and periodic processes (\cite{K}).
Due to \cite{B} the major requirment is saied to be as in the follwing:

\begin{quote}
	`If a system intsleves the execution of a real-time and non-real-time thread in alternate intervals the intervals in which real-time threads execute are scheduled to be in every $l$ time unit, then it must be ensured that the intervall begin at time $t$ where $kl \leq t \leq kl+\epsilon \quad \forall
 \epsilon \geq 0$'.
\end{quote}

Moreover there is this requirement $\mathcal{B}$.
\begin{quote}
For $L>\epsilon$ (for a suitable $\epsilon$) for which the real-time thread schedule has asserted a real-time thread $\tau$ to be expectet on the CPU, there must be a function of the method by which the minimum number of CPU cycles avialable to execute the instructions of $\tau$ can be determined.
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Model of a sporadic disriptive process}
ommited because of a mighty redudandeny

\paragraph*{Encapsulation of a scheduled process}
 
The scheduler found  in \cite{K} is going to be classified for the scope of implementation. It is an encapsulated EDF (earlies-deadline-first) process with scheduling inside the represenatative process. Let
      
\begin{align}
 & \delta_p \in \mathbb{N} \quad \text{be a periodic disruptive process and}\\
 	&\delta_s \in  \mathbb{N} \quad \text{be an asporadic disruptive process.}\\
	 &\text{Let} \quad P := \{1, \cdots, n \} \subset \mathbb{N}^n \quad \text{be an disruptable process.}  \\
 	&\text{Let} \quad  \delta p_i, \quad \text{for} \quad i = 1,..,n \quad  \text{denote the period and}  \\
 	&\delta e_i \quad \text{for} \quad  i = 1,..,n \quad  \text{denote the execution time}.  
\end{align}   

Moreover, we define the slotted priority modell by Bollea with Kaiser's sporadic and periodic disruptive process with a discrete time in contrast to these autors.
This chioce is due to the real-time model from \cite{PROSA_schedubility_analysis} and the real-time kernel as in  \cite[chp. 5.3]{B}. 

\begin{definition}
	Time is $\mathbb{N}$.
\end{definition}

According to \cite[]{} due to the establishing the exclusion model we denote by

\begin{equation}
\sigma: \mathbb{N}^n \times \mathbb{N}^n\longrightarrow \mathbb{N} 
\end{equation}
a scheduler satisfying an EDF-regulation \ref{}. TODO: Add this condition.


\begin{definition}
Let $P_i\in \mathcal{P}$ be a process and 
\begin{equation}
P^j_i = ( \Delta p_i, r_i) \in \mathbb{N}_o^2,  
\end{equation}
where $\Delta p_i$ is called the period and $r_i$ the residum. 
\end{definition}
Furthermore, time controlled process allocation due to \cite{B} and \cite[p. 34]{K} is defined as in the following.

\begin{definition}
Let $\sigma: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}_0 \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_0$ be a function called the time schedule or implementation plan.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\forall t \in \mathbb{R}^+$ we have $\sigma(t)\in \{1,2,...,n\}$
\item 
\[
  \sigma(t) = \begin{cases}
            	k > 0 \quad \text{we say the process} \quad  P_k \quad \text{is working at time} \quad t. \\
               0 \quad  \text{the process is not working. Then the idel-process of the operating system is working.  \\
            \end{cases}
\]	
%% &\text{If} \quad \sigma(t) = k > 0 \quad \text{we say the process} \quad  P_k \quad \text{is working at time}t.\\
%%		&\text{If} \quad \sigma(t)= 0 \quad  \text{the process is not working. \\
%%		&Then the idel-process of the operating system is working.} 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Note that $\sigma$ is a step-function. 
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
 $\sigma$ is well-defined.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Recall the definition of a map \ref{}. We have:
\end{proof}
