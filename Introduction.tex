\section{Introduction}


This is a summary of the electronic text-book \cite{PACGGHSY} with comments from the author and based on the peers and supervisors feedback.
This summary aims to be give a clear instruction of the usage and applicability of Coq.\\

\subsection{Preface}
Within this introduction the mathematical underpinning of reliable software is given the building blocks are
\begin{itemize}
\item basics concepts of logic (see sec. \ref{} % TODO:)
\item computer assisted theorem prving (see sec. \ref{} %TODO:)
\item Coq-proof assistant (see sec. \ref{} %TODO:
\item functional programming ( see sec. \ref{} %TODO)
\item operational semantics (see sec. \ref{} %TODO:)
\item logics for reasoning about programs (see sec. \ref{} %TODO: )
\item static type systems (see sec. \ref{} %TODO:)
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Overview}
There is a lot of motivation for reliable software. 
First of all the scale, complexity and number of involved people in modern systems is increasing.
Therefore building correct software is extremely difficult.
The information processing is waved into every aspect of society, 
therefore the costs of bugs and insecurities are amplified to multiple levels.\\
Computer scientists and software engineers have responded to improve reliability with a lot of design threats and to improve reliability and mathematical technices for reasoning.
The within this work the it should be contributed to validates these properties. They are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item basic tools from logic for making and justifying precise claims about programs
\item use of proof assistants to construct rigorous logical arguments
\item functional programmings as method of programming and simplifying reasoning about programs as a bridge between programming and logic
\end{enumerate}
