 \paragraph{Enumerated Typ}
  The bulit-in features set is extremely small in Coq. It is a powerful mechanism for defining data types from scratch. Current Coq distributions are preloaded with an extensive strandart library. Boolean numbers may comme data structure lists and hash readbales. 
  \begin{example}
  We define a type.
  Inductive day: Type :=
  | monday
  |tuesday
  | wendsday
  | thuresday
  | friday
  \end{example}
