 \paragraph{Enumerated Type}
  The built-in features set is extremely small in Coq. It is a powerful mechanism for defining data types from scratch. Current Coq distributions are preloaded with an extensive standard library.
   Boolean numbers may come data structure lists and hash readable. 
  \begin{example}
  We define a type.  
  \begin{lstlisting}
    Inductive day: Type :=
  | monday
  | tuesday
  | wednsday
  | thursday
  | friday.
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{example}
